## ShamJam '19

My first game jam. Worked with a team of 5, was the only programmer.</br>
Wrote .cs files for generating character bios & stats, menu navigation, score calculation.</br>

**Theme:**</br>
Eclipse </br>

**Description:**</br>
Designed a game in which you sacrifice a villager from your town daily to appease your god.
Villagers have (3) stats which must be balanced (scores calculated from the sum of that stat for all living villagers),
as well as a 4th stat, "God's love", which decreases each round (scores calculated from the sum of all positive stats for all living villagers).
Intent of the "God's love" stat is to encourage players to make "more holy" sacrifices
by killing off villagers with more positive stats.


## Ludum Dare #44
My second game jam. Worked alone.</br>
Wrote .cs files for a top down shooter (WASD & mouse for aiming), a shop with randomly selected items, and a skill tree.</br>
NOTE: This project was not finished.

**Theme:**</br>
Health is Currency</br>

**Description:**</br>
Roguelike top-down shooter where players try to survive in an arena for as long as possible.
Players begin the game with a set amount of health and cannot gain health for the rest of the game.
Killing enemies will award xp, and when the player levels up, they must select a skill from a skill tree.
Each upgrade costs hp in addition to a skill point.
Additionally, weapons will run out of ammo/break, forcing the player to purchase new weapons from a shop.
All purchase cost hp.
Also, each weapon has a knockback stat, which pushes enemies away upon impact. The force of the knockback is unique to each weapon.
